    > E = SNC/Category I - effluent violations of monthly average limits (Technical Review Criteria and chronic)
    > X = SNC/Category I - effluent violations of non-monthly average limits (Technical Review Criteria and chronic)
    > T = SNC/Category I - compliance schedule reporting violation
    > D = SNC/Category I - reporting violation - nonreceipt of DMR
    > N = RNC/Category II - reportable non-compliance
    > P = Resolved Pending - an enforcement action has been issued, and facility compliance with the action is pending final completion
    > R = Resolved - the facility has returned to compliance with its permit conditions, either with or without issuance of an enforcement action
    > C = Not considered in RNC/SNC based on manual review of data by state or EPA region. This manual override status is also indicated by a superscripted "m".
    > Blank = Not considered in RNC/SNC
    > N/A = EPA's data system is not able to determine the facility-level compliance status based upon the information available. This information may be available from a state database.
